/**
 * Idle React-commit-rate perf gate.
 *
 * Companion to react-commits.spec.ts. That spec measures commits during a
 * single SPA navigation; this one measures the **steady-state** commits/sec
 * after the page has fully settled with no user input. The two together
 * catch two distinct regression classes:
 *
 *  - navigation: a #6149-style cascade that runs during route transitions
 *  - idle: a #6201-style cascade where a wall-clock interval, an unstable
 *    provider value, or a sub-second tick keeps re-rendering the tree
 *    forever even when nothing is happening
 *
 * The idle case is invisible to the navigation gate because that gate only
 * watches the 2-second window after a sidebar click. A 1Hz ticker that
 * fires forever would never be flagged by the navigation gate; it would
 * happily report 14 commits per nav while accumulating ~30 commits/sec
 * idle in the background. We need a separate signal for it.
 *
 * Same dev-server requirement as react-commits.spec.ts: React 19 only calls
 * `onCommitFiberRoot` in dev mode, so this runs against `vite dev` via
 * `PERF_DEV=1` in the workflow.
 *
 * See #6201 for the regression class this gate exists to catch.
